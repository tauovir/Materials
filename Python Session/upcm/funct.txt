Argument Passing Summary
Argument passing in Python can be summarized as follows. Passing an immutable object, like an int, str, tuple, or frozenset, to a Python function acts like pass-by-value. The function can’t modify the object in the calling environment.

Passing a mutable object such as a list, dict, or set acts somewhat—but not exactly—like pass-by-reference. The function can’t reassign the object wholesale, but it can change items in place within the object, and these changes will be reflected in the calling environmen
